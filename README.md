Overview
This Login Application is developed as a test for B2Bit. It is a simple React application designed to demonstrate the implementation of an user login interface. The app provides a basic login form where users can enter their credentials.

It utilizes styled components as a way of separating CSS and Typescript, allowing for more modular and maintainable code by defining styles directly within the component files.
It also uses styled component's theme context to provide visual elements as variables centralized in a theme file.
